Creating a mini Java project that focuses on arrays can be both educational and fun, providing a hands-on way to improve your Java skills. Hereâ€™s an idea for a mini project that will help you practice arrays, algorithms, and possibly GUI development if you choose to add a graphical interface.

Mini Project: Expense Tracker Application
Project Overview:
Develop a simple console-based (or GUI-based, if you're up for a challenge) expense tracker application in Java. The application will allow users to add, view, and delete expenses. Each expense will have a description and an amount. You'll use arrays to store and manage these expenses.

Core Features:

Add an Expense: Allow the user to input an expense amount and description, storing this information in an array.
View Expenses: Display all added expenses with their descriptions and amounts.
Delete an Expense: Let the user delete an expense by specifying its position in the array.
Calculate Total Expenses: Calculate and display the total amount of all expenses.
Advanced Features (Optional):

Sort Expenses: Implement functionality to sort expenses by amount or description.
Search for an Expense: Allow the user to search for expenses by their description.
Save and Load Expenses: Implement file I/O to save expenses to a file and load them back into the application on startup.
GUI Implementation: For a more user-friendly experience, create a graphical user interface using JavaFX or Swing.
Technical Considerations:

Use an ArrayList for easier management of dynamic expense entries. If focusing on core array concepts, use a traditional array and manage its capacity manually.
Practice good software development principles such as code modularity, clarity, and reuse.
