Project: Contact Management System

Project Goal: Create a Java application that manages contacts using a singly linked list. The application will be capable of adding new contacts, deleting existing ones, and searching for specific contacts based on their information.

Core Concepts to Practice:

Node Creation: Understand how to define a node class with necessary attributes.
List Operations: Implement methods for adding nodes (contacts), deleting nodes, and finding nodes within the list.
Traversal: Practice traversing the linked list to perform operations like displaying all contacts.
Edge Cases: Handle edge cases such as inserting at the beginning/end of the list or deleting the first/last element.
Features to Implement:

Add Contact: Prompt the user to enter contact details and add a new contact to the list.
Delete Contact: Allow the user to delete a contact by a unique identifier, such as name or email.
Search Contact: Enable searching for a contact and display the details.
Display Contacts: Show a list of all contacts currently stored.
Exit Program: Give the user the option to exit the program.
User Interface: You can use the console for input and output operations. Make it interactive with a simple text menu that provides options to perform the various features.

Testing: After implementation, thoroughly test each feature to ensure that your linked list handles all operations correctly.

By the end of this project, you should have a stronger understanding of how singly linked lists function in Java, particularly how they manage memory and pointers (references in Java). This will also solidify your understanding of object-oriented programming principles.
