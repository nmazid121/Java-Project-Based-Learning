Number Guessing 

Overview

The Number Guessing Game is a simple Java console application where the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and then attempts to guess it using a binary search algorithm. 
This game demonstrates the efficiency of binary search compared to linear search and provides an interactive way to understand how these algorithms work.

Features

Random Number Generation: The game generates a random number for the computer to guess.
Binary Search Algorithm: The computer uses a binary search algorithm to efficiently guess the random number.
Guess Feedback: After each guess, the game provides feedback on whether the computer's guess was too high or too low.

How to Run

Compile the Java program using javac NumberGuessing.java.
Run the compiled class with java NumberGuessing.
The computer will automatically start guessing the number, with feedback provided for each guess.

How it Works

The generateRandomNumber method generates a random number between 1 and 100.
The main method initializes an array with numbers from 1 to 100 to simulate a range of numbers.
The binary search is performed within the main method using a while loop that continues until the computer guesses the correct number.
The game prints out whether each guess is too high or too low until the correct number is guessed.

Note

The linear search functionality and user guessing functionality are commented out but can be included for additional features.
