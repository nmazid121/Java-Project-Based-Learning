Project Title: Employee Management System with Bubble Sort
Project Description:
Develop an Employee Management System (EMS) in Java that utilizes the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort employees based on various attributes such as employee ID, name, or salary. 
The system will provide functionalities to add, update, delete, and display employee records. Sorting employees will help in quickly accessing records in an organized manner.

Key Features:

Employee Record Management: Implement functionalities to add new employee records, update existing ones, delete records, and retrieve and display records from the system.
Sorting Functionality: Integrate Bubble Sort to sort employee records. Provide options to sort by different attributes like ID, name, and salary.
Command-Line Interface: Develop a simple and user-friendly command-line interface (CLI) that allows users to interact with the system.
File Handling: Store employee records in a file and implement file handling to read and write records. This will make the data persistent across system restarts.
Search Functionality: Implement a search feature to find employee records based on attributes like name or ID.

Technologies and Tools:
Java: The primary programming language for building the system.
File Handling in Java: For reading from and writing to files, ensuring data persistence.
Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA: Recommended IDEs for Java development.


Steps to Get Started:

Plan Your Application: Define the structure of an employee record (e.g., ID, name, department, salary). Plan the functionalities and commands your CLI will support.
Setup Your Development Environment: Ensure Java is installed and choose an IDE.
Implement Data Structures: Define classes and data structures for handling employee records.
Develop the CLI: Create a CLI for user interaction, using standard input and output.


Implement Bubble Sort: Write a Bubble Sort function that can sort employee records based on specified attributes.
File Handling: Implement functions to read from and write to a file for storing employee records.
Integrate Sorting with the EMS: Use your Bubble Sort implementation to sort records as part of the system's functionality.
Testing: Test your system thoroughly with various scenarios to ensure all functionalities work as expected.


Stretch Goals:
GUI Implementation: Enhance the system by developing a graphical user interface (GUI) using Java Swing or JavaFX.
More Sorting Options: Add functionality to sort by multiple attributes simultaneously (e.g., department then salary).
Advanced Search: Implement more advanced search capabilities, such as partial matches for names.
This project focuses on applying Bubble Sort in a real-world scenario, improving your understanding of sorting algorithms while also broadening your experience with Java development, particularly in handling more complex data structures and file operations.
